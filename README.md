## What is API Managment:
```Console
API management is the process of:
$ Building
$ Publishing
$ Securing
$ Versioning
$ Observing
$ Scaling
$ Cataloging
$ Retiring APIs
```

## Popular APIM Solutions features:
An API management solution is a SaaS or PaaS product at the end of the day, aiming at making APIM process easier and more efficient. But, every Open-Source APIM Solution or Platform tool out there has specific requirements and implementation limitations. Here we will list some of these popular features.

```Console
$ API Gateway
- [1] Handles the routing and management for all your APIs through policies that can be applied to individual APIs 
or a set of APIs.
- [2] rate-limiting: general-purpose capability to protect one‚Äôs information system from DDoS attacks.
- [3] Complex rate-limiting: e.g. for Billing
When a business is to sell data, they might sell them based on volume consumption. A central-access-point 
aka API Gateway suits complex distributed architectures that rely on several services to serve the required data 
and can reliably measure and charge usage.
```

```Console
$ API Portal
- User interfaces models for API "Management / Publishing / Documenting" which serves as a self-service hub for 
developers to gain access / introduced to avaliable APIs and other resources needed for consuming them.
```

```Console
$ API Dashboard
- Where you can observe API usage, view key API metrics, and manage a variety of API analytics.
```

```Console
$ API Catalog
- Organizing, cataloging, indexing, and presenting all the public and private APIs that are used in an 
organization.
```

```Console
$ API Builder
- Enable the use of low-code / no-code tools to design, build, integrate, and deploy APIs.
```


## How to Pick the Right Open-Source API Management Solution
```Console
$ [1] Features: 
The foremost factor to consider is the features provided from the APIMP.
Every OS-APIMP tool has specific requirements and implementation limitations.
So, performing a comparison in terms of your technical and non-technical requirements can be really helpful.
```

```Console
$ [2] Deployment Complexity:
Some gateways require:
- single-node while others run on multiple-nodes.
- many databases to operate, which can be a complicated thing to manage.
So, deployment-complexity is our second factor for finding the right OS-APIM.
```

```Console
$ [3] On-Premise vs Cloud hosted:
- On-Premise: can add more time to the deployment and maintenance process.
- Cloud-hosted: can introduce more latency due to the extra-hop and even lower down the availability
of your service when the vendor goes down.
Analyzing the pros and cons of both the options to determine which open-source API management tool to embrace
can also be a profitable idea.
```

```Console
$ [4] Community Support:
Having an idea of the type of community support each API management open source tool needs also helps in 
choosing the right one. The larger and active a community is, the higher are the chances of receiving 
updates and solutions to your queries; ultimately resulting in a better experience.
```
